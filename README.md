## All credit for this software goes to [Alec Hammond](https://github.com/smartalecH). I simply made a minor change, and added better installation instructions, so that it is easier to install

## How to install this software

Install the dependencies:

```sudo apt install libboost-all-dev libblas-dev liblapack-dev cmake autoconf libtool fort77 libeigen3-dev perl```

## SUPERLU installation

Clone the SUPERLU repository:

```git clone https://github.com/xiaoyeli/superlu.git```

Install SUPERLU:

  ```cd superlu
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  sudo make install
  cd ../..
  ```

## ARPACK-NG installation

Clone the ARPACK-NG repository:

```git clone https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng.git```

Install ARPACK-NG:

  ```cd arpack-ng
  sh bootstrap
  cp /path/to/pkg.m4 m4/ (this was /usr/share/aclocal/pkg.m4 for me)
  autoreconf -if
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install
  cd ../..
  ```

## And finally... WGMS3D installation

Clone this repository, and install WGMS3D:

  ```cd wgms3d
  ./configure --with-superlu=/path/to/superlu --with-arpack=/path/to/arpack-ng
  autoreconf -if
  make
  sudo make install
  sudo ldconfig # necessary for first run
  cd ../..
  ```

Also consider installing [pyMode](https://github.com/smartalecH/pymode), a Python module for working with WGMS3D.

That's about it! I hope this is helpful. If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue.
